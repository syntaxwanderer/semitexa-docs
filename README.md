What were the pain points that drove me to create Semitexa?

#### The Economics of Simplicity
I remember the era when the LAMP stack literally took over the market from giant corporations. The reason was simple: **affordability**. But times have changed, and PHP projects have become incredibly expensive. My goal is to reclaim that former glory by making development economically viable again.

#### Beyond the "Born to Die" Paradigm
"PHP is born to die" — this metaphor describes the fundamental Request-Response principle. While it saved us for years, it has outlived its dominance. Modern challenges led me to look toward **Swoole**.

I hold immense respect for existing frameworks, but today's massive projects are becoming too inert. Semitexa is an alternative—a tool designed to handle scaling as a core function.

#### Lessons from Magento and "The Elegance Paradox"
Special thanks to the Magento community for the deep understanding of complex architectures. There, I encountered **"The Elegance Paradox"**: it’s difficult to explain to a business why clean architecture is expensive. When you justify costs with "architecture," they hear "bad architecture." Semitexa aims to bridge this gap.

#### AI Agents: A New Board, New Rules
AI Agents haven't just flipped the chessboard; they’ve started playing a different game. I don't intend to fight this. On the contrary, after researching why LLMs hallucinate with top frameworks, I designed Semitexa to be **AI-oriented** from the ground up.

#### Gratitude
Thanks to my "teachers": Zend, CodeIgniter, Kohana, Symfony, Laravel, Magento 2. Semitexa is an expression of cognitive variance and a reflection on new challenges. Open Source is now my top priority.

### Documentation conventions

Technical documentation in each package (e.g. semitexa-core/docs) follows a simple structure so humans and agents can find things quickly:

- **Purpose** — what this doc or feature is for.
- **When to use / Scope** — when to reach for it.
- **Rules or Steps** — what to do (and what not to do).
- **Where it lives** — files, classes, or commands.

Where it helps, package docs include a short **Rationale** or **Why** — the reason behind a design choice — so that "why we did it this way" is explicit and the codebase stays understandable and pleasant to work with.
